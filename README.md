From RIAEvangelist/node-ipc

> Removed [problematic peacenotwar](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/peacenotwar) module and all related commits. You should probably not trust me either, but I will try my best to not add any protestware to this repo

If you want to use this fork, you can add it to your project like this: 

```    
"node-ipc": "git+ssh://git@github.com:mbrjun/node-ipc.git",
```
Probably you should just fork it again and replace my username with yours, while working on replacing this module with an alternative/maintained fork.
