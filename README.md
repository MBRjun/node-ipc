node-ipc
================

> Removed [problematic peacenotwar](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/peacenotwar) module and all related commits. You should probably not trust me either, but I will try my best to not add any protestware to this repo

If you want to use this fork, you can add it to your project like this: 

```    
"node-ipc": "git+ssh://git@github.com:lukas-mertens/node-ipc.git",
```
Probably you should just fork it again and replace my username with yours, while working on replacing this module with an alternative/maintained fork.

Please find all additional information in the [original README](https://github.com/lukas-mertens/node-ipc/blob/b78969d04516212da5cd0e75612b6fe1890fa742/README.md)
